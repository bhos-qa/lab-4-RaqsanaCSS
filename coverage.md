Statement Coverage
Statement coverage assesses the percentage of executable lines in the code that have been executed during testing. It helps identify untested code, ensuring that every line has been executed at least once, but it may not reveal logical errors as it doesn't consider the various paths through the code.

Branch Coverage
Branch coverage measures whether all possible branches from decision points in the code (such as if statements) have been executed. This coverage type improves upon statement coverage by ensuring both true and false outcomes are tested, providing better insight into the control flow and revealing untested paths.

Predicate Coverage
Predicate coverage focuses on the boolean expressions within conditional statements, ensuring that all potential outcomes (true and false) of those expressions are evaluated during testing. It provides a deeper analysis of logical conditions, helping to identify intricate bugs related to decision-making processes in the code.
